🧠 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

AI Synthetic Market Intelligence Engine

Layer 1 — Market Context Intelligence

Input:

Product description

Price

Target geography

Category

Marketing visual (image)

Process:

LLM interprets positioning

Generates structured brand hypothesis

Extracts perceived signals (luxury, affordability, innovation, etc.)

Output:

{
  "category": "D2C skincare",
  "price_positioning": "premium mass",
  "brand_personality": ["modern", "science-backed"],
  "target_psychographics": ["aspirational", "digitally engaged"]
}
Layer 2 — Population Modeling Engine

Instead of random generation, we simulate population distributions:

Age distribution curve

Income distribution curve

Urban vs Tier 2

Digital exposure index

Big Five personality vectors

Each persona gets:

Demographics

Socioeconomic band

Psychographic vector

Purchase power index

Risk tolerance

Brand receptivity score

This is probabilistic modeling — not sampling from a list.

Layer 3 — Agent Cognition Simulation

Each persona is an autonomous reasoning agent:

Agent receives:

Market context

Their own personality vector

The marketing visual interpretation

Agent produces:

Emotional reaction

Trust score

Confusion points

Purchase probability

Verbatim-style feedback

This is LLM-conditioned reasoning, not template strings.

Layer 4 — Multi-Agent Focus Group Simulation

We then simulate:

6-person moderated panel

Agents react to each other

Opinion shifts tracked

Social influence effects modeled

This mimics real group dynamics.

Layer 5 — Intelligence Synthesis Engine

Aggregates:

Segment clustering via embeddings

Emotional polarity distribution

Objection frequency

Messaging resonance map

Price elasticity estimate

Outputs:

Strategic positioning shifts

Risk heatmap

Go/No-Go signal

Creative optimization suggestions

🔥 PROTOTYPE STACK

Frontend:

Streamlit (enhanced UI)

Tabs

Persona cards

Radar charts

Distribution plots

Backend:

OpenAI API (LLM reasoning)

NumPy + SciPy (population modeling)

scikit-learn (clustering)

SentenceTransformers (feedback embedding clustering)

Matplotlib (no seaborn per rules)
